Description
===========

CarlTour is an iPhone app aimed at prospective Carleton students. Our app can be used to
learn more about the buildings on campus, and to take self guided tours. Our app also
tells users about events that are going on around campus and provides a useful interface
for searching and filtering them.


Status
======

Our app is almost bug free. We are currently working on resolving an issue with
map annotation call outs disappearing immediately after a user taps a building. Try
tapping a building twice if you're having issues.


Getting Stated
==============

You should be able to just clone our repository, build, and run! There is no need to run
the server locally.

Note
====

Our project resides in two repositories. The mobile app can be found at:
https://github.com/CarlTour/CarlTour
and the server can be found at:
https://github.com/CarlTour/CarlTourBackEnd
